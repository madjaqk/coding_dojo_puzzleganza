		<p>This puzzle is a series short sound clips along with a grid.  There are the same number of clips as there are rows in the grid (not counting the "???"), and one cell in each row is shaded blue, so dollars to doughnuts we're going to need identify something in each clip and enter it in the diagram, reading a message in the shaded squares.</p>
		<p>The clips are someone singing <i>a capella</i>, but instead of traditional lyrics, the person is clearly describing someone or something specific.  For instance, the second file is, "The Gordian knot is hard to untie/Is there anyone who can defeat it/A man comes along cuts it off with a sword/Who can this be?/Believe it or not, it's just he," which leads to the answer ALEXANDER THE GREAT.  What do with it, though?</p>
		<p>If you're pop culture savvy, the tunes may sound familar; that second clip is "Believe It or Not" by Joes Scarbury, for instance.  Listen to a few more, and you might notice a pattern: All of these are TV theme songs.  (This is also clued by the puzzle's flavor text.)  Not just that, but the TV show and whatever is being described can be linked together, á la a Before and After puzzle on <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> or <em>Jeopardy</em>, to give a Frankenstein's monster of a phrase like ALEXANDER THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO or CALVINBALL IN THE FAMILY.  Indeed, these compound phrases fit perfectly in the grid.  We know, for instance, that the second row has to be ZERO DARK THIRTY ROCK, because there's no other place that would fit.  Reading the shaded letters gives CHANDLER CAN'T CRY ??? UNAGI, which I'll admit baffled me the first time I saw it, but some quick time on Google will reveal those are both pieces of <em>Friends</em> episode titles, "The One Where Chandler Can't Cry" and "The One With Unagi".  The episode that aired between them (where the question marks are in the grid) is "The One That Could Have Been", which gives the answer COULD HAVE BEEN.</p>
