		<p>Note that nothing on this page is a hard and fast rule, and even if it were, that would just make puzzle constructors even more excited to break them.  Think of all of this as general suggestions.</p>
		<h3>Puzzle-Solving Advice</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Read the title and flavor text.</strong>  The title and flavor text (short, italicized text before a puzzle begins) usually won't tell you want to do directly, but might include hints (including, often, bad puns).  One common example is for the flavor text to reference tapping, dots, or dashes as a clue that the puzzle encodes something in Morse code.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Do what seems obvious...</strong>  If there are crossword-style clues, solve them.  If there's a sudoku grid, fill it in.  If there are pictures, try to identify them.  Don't worry if you don't know what to do with this information when you're done; fingers-crossed you'll notice something as you go on.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>...but what out for anything unusual.</strong>  Many puzzles are a "normal" type, but with a twist.  Maybe it's a crossword, but some of the clues don't match the answers (but would if you removed a letter).  Maybe it's a sudoku that doesn't have a unique solution.  Maybe there are multiple pictures of things with similar names, like Bjorn Born and a Borg from <em>Star Trek</em>.  Pay attention to anything that doesn't seem like it fits.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Ask yourself what information you haven't used yet.</strong> Puzzles are usually carefully constructed, and if done well, every piece of it should be used.  One example might be a series of movie reviews, where each one includes a star rating.  Maybe you'll have to rearrange the blurbs based on the rating, or use the ratings to index in to the title (so two stars means to take the second letter).  Similar to this, pay attention to what order things are listed in.  Usually there's a clear order that might help your solve (for instance, there's a bunch of headshots in alphabetical order by the celebrity's name), and if there's not, it means you probably won't have to rearrange anything as part of the solution.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Don't be afraid to Google it.</strong>  Sometimes puzzles are built around esoteric knowledge and might take some research.  There's a famous story that an early MIT Mystery Hunt included a puzzle written in Linear B (one of the earliest known languages), and before the Hunt began the author checked out all of the books on the subject from the school library; in 2016, I solved a metapuzzle by getting frustrated, dumping all of the answers in Google, then being shocked to learn they were all names of Westminster Dog Show champions.  Similarly, there's nothing wrong with using online anagram finders or cryptogram solvers, and usually the puzzles are written with those in mind.

		</ul>
		<p>I've also written up more detailed solutions for a few puzzles from the MIT Mystery Hunt, if you want to get a sense of the steps necessary to solve these types of puzzles.  (You can also check out the Mystery Hunt archives; every puzzle for almost 20 years has a solution posted.)</p>
